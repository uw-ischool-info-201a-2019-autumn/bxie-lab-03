# A1. Search "iris" in Help. What is the dataset about?

# A2. Get all rows of Species 'versicolor' in a new data frame. Call this data frame: 'iris.vers'

# A3. Get a vector called 'sepal.dif' with the difference between 'Sepal.Length' and 'Sepal.Width' of 'versicolor' plants.

# A4. Add 'iris.vers' with the new column 'sepal.dif'.

# A5. filter for all data of Species 'virginica' with a 'Sepal.Width' of greater than 3.5.

# A6. get a data frame of  all data of Species 'setosa' with a 'Sepal.Width' of greater than 3.5, but without the last column Species in the data frame?

# A7. Write a function that takes in a species name as an argument and returns the average Sepal Width of that species.

# A8. What is the average Sepal.Length for 'versicolor' species having a Petal.Length of 4.2 or higher?
