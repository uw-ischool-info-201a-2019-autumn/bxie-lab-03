# TODO B1. Read data/seattle_bike_meta.md to understand the data. 
# How many columns are there? What is each column's data type?
# What is the difference between data collected for the two locations?

# TODO B2: Load the dataset from data/seattle_bike.csv (you may need to set the working directory)

# TODO B3: View the dataset. Is it what you expect? Are there missing or malformed data?

# TODO B4. Create new columns which total all bikes which cross the fremont bridge (regardless of pathway) 
# and totals all bikes which cross the Burke Gilman (regardless of direction). 

# TODO: B5. The City of Seattle believes the Burke Gilman is used more so for recreational cyclists 
# and the Fremont Bridge is used more so for commuters. 
# Can you provide evidence to support or refute this claim? Assume people typically work on weekdays and have weekends off.
